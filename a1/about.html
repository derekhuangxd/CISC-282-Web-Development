<p>
	I&rsquo;ve been a resident of this city for the majority of my life and a homeowner in District 18 for the last decade. I truly enjoy living here and I want my efforts as a Councillor to have a positive impact on the city. Please <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a> with any ideas you might have to improve the municipality.

<h4>
	Career
</h4>

<p>
	I began my career working with the Commissioner of Community Services and, after many excellent years, I resigned to pursue municipal politics. I’ve since had the pleasure of serving as the councillor for District 18 for over 8 years. I serve on both the Administrative Policies and Planning committees.
